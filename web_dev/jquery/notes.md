To learn about JQuery, I will search for a few different resources on the web.  I will look for various formats (video, text, intro courses, etc), and spend a few minutes familiarizing myself with each.  I will then determine which resource seems to be the most informative, and proceed with that (referring to other resources when needed).

I will create a few test files to play around with JQuery as I go along - after each actionable piece of information i have learned.

Breaks shall be taken!  At times that make sense (hopefully every 30 mins or so)
