# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to make incremental changes (commits), track them, decide when to push/pull them into the master branch, and view past changes.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a clone of an existing repository.  You can add changes/features to a branch without altering the master repository, and then merge changes into the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in git.  A good commit message is brief, and explains what each commit is changing/addressing.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches make changes to the same lines in the same file, and thus Git may have difficulty deciding which branch merge is 'correct'.
