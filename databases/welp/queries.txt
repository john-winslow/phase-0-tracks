1.  You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
4|Dancing dogs!  Exquisite ambiance.|The Beagle Nightclub|Holly|Berry
5|Fancy sushi for fancy people.|Sushi World|Bradford|Pitt
1|Worst decision of my life.|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Angela|Jolie
5|I love having my car towed!  Amir is the best.|Amir's Towing|Mandy|Kaling
3|Oommmmmmmmmmmmm.  Namaste.|Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie
5|Sports!  In a barn!|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|Steven|Wonder
3|Fixed a leak, broke a pipe.  Meh.|Plumbing by Janet|Denzel|George
1|The barn is full of farm animals and sports equipment.  WTF?|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|Merryl|Streepman
2|Pulled a hammy.  I blame the teacher.|Lotus Yoga|Denzel|George
sqlite>


2.  There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Dancing dogs!  Exquisite ambiance.
Bradford|Pitt|Sushi World|5|Fancy sushi for fancy people.
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Worst decision of my life.
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|5|I love having my car towed!  Amir is the best.
Angela|Jolie|Lotus Yoga|3|Oommmmmmmmmmmmm.  Namaste.
Steven|Wonder|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|5|Sports!  In a barn!
Denzel|George|Plumbing by Janet|3|Fixed a leak, broke a pipe.  Meh.
Merryl|Streepman|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|1|The barn is full of farm animals and sports equipment.  WTF?
Denzel|George|Lotus Yoga|2|Pulled a hammy.  I blame the teacher.


3.  How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, reviews, users  WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id AND businesses.name = "Lotus Yoga";
4|Lotus Yoga|5|3|Oommmmmmmmmmmmm.  Namaste.|4|3|3|Angela|Jolie
4|Lotus Yoga|9|2|Pulled a hammy.  I blame the teacher.|4|7|7|Denzel|George
